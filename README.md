# Chess-Playing-AI
a chess-playing AI using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning that simulates strategic gameplay between two agents. The project involved optimizing search trees and implementing decision-making under constraints. Which will help to understand game theory, heuristics, and evaluation functions in real-world scenarios.
